                </small><br />
            Grizzard is a full-service agency partner, exclusively<br /> to non-profits. With rebranding efforts taking place<br /> along with new marketing materials the website had<br />to be updated. Grizzard needed a site that generated<br /> leads, showcased their capabilities, and focused on<br /> the client's needs. Not only was it time for a modern<br /> visual design, but a new company direction.

            Cousins Properties Incorporated (NYSE:CUZ) is a<br /> fully integrated, self-administered and self-<br />managed real estate investment trust (REIT) based<br /> in Atlanta, Georgia.

Not only was it time for a <br />modern visual design, but also for a system-wide<br /> developmental update.

        <p>More About Me<br />
             My name is Rich Haagenson, and I am a web<br />
             designer who specializes in responsive front-end<br />
             design, HTML/CSS and web typography. Some other<br />

             loved every minute of it.
